Contestant at the beginning has a 1/3 chance of winning the prize. 

After host shows what is behind one door (not the prize) there are now 2 doors remaining, one of which has the prize. 

There are only 2 doors now. One has the prize, one does not. The probability there is a prize behind one of the doors is 1/2 or 50%. 

Changing your answer does not increase or decrease the probability. You can change or not.
